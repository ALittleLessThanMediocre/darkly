## Where to Locate:

On the footer of the http://$IP/ page of our site we find some useful links to various social media pages of 42

Here we can link to other users who are interested in technology and programming. But upon inspection we observe that these links are performed by redirections instead of anchor tags.

## Exploit:

Knowing this we can attempt to exploit the open redirection vulnerability to get more users to visit our social media pages or any where else.

This is possible because no form of validation is taking place before the redirect or forwarding takes place and that the end destination is editable.

Editing the path to the redirection and clicking the link we receive our flag which is = b9e775a0291fed784a2d9680fcfad7edd6b8cdf87648da647aaf4bba288bcab3

## Prevention:

Disallow Offsite Redirects:

You can prevent redirects to other domains by checking the URL being passed to the redirect function. Make sure all redirect URLs are relative paths – i.e. they start with a single / character. (Note that URLs starting with // will be interpreted by the browser as a protocol agnostic, absolute URL – so they should be rejected too.)

If you do need to perform external redirects, consider whitelisting the individual sites that you permit redirects to.

Check the Referrer When Doing Redirects:

Redirects to URLs passed in query parameters should only be triggered by pages on your site. Any other sites triggering a redirect should be treated with extreme suspicion. As a second layer of defense, check that the Referer in the HTTP request matches your domain whenever you perform a redirect.
